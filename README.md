Face api js 
I set a real time face detection through a webcam using AI. This AI draw in real time the various faces and expressions of every person in the video. I used the Face API JS library to setup the face detection. 



The AI can recognize 6 emotions :
- Surprised
- Sad 
- Disgusted
- Angry 
- Fearful 
- Happy  


The different process of the app
- Streaming Ã  webcam through HTML 
- Using Face api to detect faces in real time 
- Drawing facial landmarks in real time 
- Determining emotion though facial expressions in real time
